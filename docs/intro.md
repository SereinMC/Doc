# Quick Start

Make sure you have a latest LTS/Current version of **[Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org/)**.

You can install **Serein** and **gulp-cli** (a required global dependency for **Serein**) using the **npm** tool.

```bash
npm i @pureeval/serein gulp-cli -g

serein # get help
```

### Quick Tip

As the **npm** package manager may perform poorly when installing some dependencies (such as taking too long), if you have the **pnpm** package manager in your environment, **Serein** will prefer to use it.

You can also use the following method to install the **pnpm** tool, which is a better package manager than **npm**!

```bash
npm i pnpm -g

pnpm --version
```
